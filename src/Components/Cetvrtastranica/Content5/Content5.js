                Football Mountain is a mountain, 830 metres (2,720 ft) high, with a prominent and peculiar rock scar called The Football on its north side, on the ridge between Edisto Inlet and Tucker Glacier in Antarctica. It was occupied as a survey station, and marked by a large rock cairn, by the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition, 1957â€“58, who named it for The Football.
